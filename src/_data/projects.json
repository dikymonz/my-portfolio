    "body": "So, picture this – me and the gang whipped up this awesome thing during my coding bootcamp. It's like the alpha version, you know? And guess what? I totally owned the whole route thingy!\nThe big idea? Keep those kiddos safe while they're out cycling. Like superhero parents and guardians. 🚴‍♀️💨\nI brought in some Leaflet.js magic and TomTom's cool Routing/Reverse Geolocation APIs. What does that mean? Well, hold tight – we've got this super interactive map that's easy on the eyes. You can basically draw out a route, all fancy, while considering stuff like traffic, bike lanes, and how steep the hills are. It's like plotting an adventure – totally kid-safe and fun!",

    "body": "Hey there, I whipped up this app with mobiles in mind, so it's all slick and dandy on any screen. The secret sauce? OpenWeatherMap API! It pulls in all the deets you need: city name, date, cute weather icons, temp, humidity, and even wind speed. But hold on, there's more! ☀️\nPeep the 5-day forecast – it's like a crystal ball for weather nerds. And I got your back with the search history thing. Saves your searches so you don't have to type it all out again.\nWait, there's a rad trick too – the dashboard goes dark or light, depending on if it's sunbathing or stargazing time in the city you're checking. Plus, it's like magic – finds where you are and tells you the weather there. No more guessing if it's raining outside!",
